# Computational Fractals and Information Theory Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of fractal geometry, dynamical systems, statistical physics simulations, and data compression algorithms developed as part of academic research and computational mathematics coursework.

The project combines theoretical concepts from nonlinear dynamics, information theory, statistical physics, and fractal geometry with practical implementations in Python.
